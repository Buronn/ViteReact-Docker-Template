# Vite React Starter Kit with Docker

This repository provides a template for building web applications using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), with Docker support for easy deployment.

The kit includes a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` file that allow you to easily build and run the application in a containerized environment. It also includes automatic site reloading using Vite's built-in development server, which will refresh the page whenever you make changes to your code.

## Getting started

To use this starter kit, simply clone the repository and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start the development server on `localhost:3000`. You can then start editing the code and see the changes reflected in your browser as you go.

## Features

- Vite for fast and efficient development
- React for building user interfaces
- Docker support for easy deployment
- Automatic site reloading for faster iteration
- ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style
